## Trilinos Background

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
scientific problems.  A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
focus on packages.  Full details of Trilinos and links to package
websites can be found at the
[Trilinos home page](https://trilinos.github.io "Trilinos Home Page").

## Meeting Overview

We are pleased to announce the 2023 Trilinos User Group Meeting
(TUG23) will be held October 31st through November 2nd, 2023 at
Sandia National Laboratories, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The
tentative agenda is
 
 * Monday PM, Oct. 30th – Kokkos Beginner's Tutorial
 * Tuesday AM, Oct. 31st – Keynote Speaker and Area/Package Updates
 * Tuesday PM, Oct. 31st – Trilinos Hackathon
 * Wednesday AM/PM, Nov. 1st – Application and User Talks
 * Thursday AM/PM, Nov. 2nd – Developer’s Day
 
As in previous years, this will be a hybrid meeting with both virtual
and in-person attendees.  We do encourage everyone to consider
attending in-person, so that we can get together and talk about
Trilinos.  Both the Application and Developers Day have run into
the afternoon due to the amount of material we would like to cover.
 
<b>Tutorial and Hack-a-thon</b>

Additionally, we will be having a Kokkos Beginner's Tutorial on the
afternoon of Oct. 30th (Monday PM), and a Trilinos Hackathon the
afternoon of Oct. 31st (Tuesday PM).  If you would like to work
with Trilinos developers during the hackathon, please let us know.
We would like to connect you to them to help incorporate
and use Trilinos in your application.  If you are interested in
this, please let us know early with your registration.

## Keynote

Placeholder Title "Sandia's HPC Hardware" Jim Laros (Sandia National Laboratories)

In this presentation, I will give a hopefully informal interactive
talk attempting to touch on various topics related to the history
of High-Performance Computing (HPC) in Sandia’s Center for Computing
Research (CCR) and what the future might hold.  As we gaze into the
crystal ball together, we will look at the motivations and possibilities
for future technologies and speculate on what we may see in the
coming 5-10 years, while avoiding Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
information.  I’ll touch on the NNSA platform strategy and present
some history of the path from prototypes to large platform installations
using examples from first our Advanced Architecture Test Bed program
and more recently our Vanguard program and the impact we hope to
have on future NNSA architectures.


## Tentative Agenda
All times in Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) Denver, U.S. (UTC-06:00).
