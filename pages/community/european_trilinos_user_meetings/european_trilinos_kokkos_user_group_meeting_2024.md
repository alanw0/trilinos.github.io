**European Trilinos & Kokkos User Group Meeting 2024**  
**June 24-26, 2024**  
**Location:** Hamburg, Germany

The European Trilinos & Kokkos User Group (EuroTUG 2024) meeting will take place on the campus of the Helmut-Schmidt-University / University of the Federal Armed Forces Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany on June 24-26, 2024. For the first time, the workshop further strives to bring together Kokkos users and developers in the same spirit. This will not only foster efforts in the European Kokkos community with regard to scientific computing on heterogeneous hardware, but it will also leverage additional synergies between Trilinos and Kokkos developments.
