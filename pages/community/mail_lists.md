The Trilinos Project and related packages maintain a number of email lists that users can subscribe to. We recommend that users subscribe to the following mailing lists as appropriate.

*   [Trilinos-Announce Mailing List](https://trilinos.org/mailman/listinfo/trilinos-announce_trilinos.org) -- Low-volume, primarily for Trilinos release announcements. (Highly Recommended)
*   [Trilinos-Users Mailing List](https://trilinos.org/mailman/listinfo/trilinos-users_trilinos.org) -- Discussion forum for users of Trilinos. (Recommended)

In addition to the Trilinos versions of these lists, each package typically has its own lists with the naming format: package-announce@software.sandia.gov and package-users@software.sandia.gov where “package” is the name of the package, e.g. epetra. Due to spam, we no longer maintain a complete list of mail lists. To subscribe to a list other than the two shown above, please modify this url accordingly for the specific package and list type you are interested in:
